# Incognito Theme  

## “VS Code in Notepad++ disguise.”

### A light, high-contrast theme designed for shell scripts, system editing, and anyone who wants VS Code to *look* like a classic text editor but *feel* like a modern IDE
### *(Unfortuanately HEREDOCS don't show with a tinted background - still a limitation within VS Code)*
---

### 🌟 Features

- Notepad++-inspired layout with modern clarity  
- Subtle color coding for readability without eye strain  
- Ideal for Bash, Shell, and lightweight scripting  
- Designed for developers who miss simplicity
