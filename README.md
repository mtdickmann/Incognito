- Designed for developers who miss simplicity

### 🧩 Installation (Manual)

If you downloaded the theme as a `.vsix` file, you can install it directly into VS Code — no marketplace needed.

#### 🪟 Windows
1. Download the latest release file (for example):  
   ```text
   incognito-1.0.8.vsix
   ```
2. Open **Visual Studio Code**.  
3. Open a terminal using the menu:  
   **View → Terminal** (or click the **Terminal** tab at the bottom).  
4. Run the following command (adjust the path if needed):  
   ```bash
   code --install-extension "C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\Downloads\incognito-1.0.8.vsix"
   ```
5. Restart VS Code.  
6. Open the Command Palette (**Ctrl+Shift+P**) → run **“Preferences: Color Theme”** → select **Incognito**.  

#### 🐧 Linux / 🧠 macOS
1. Open a terminal in the folder where the `.vsix` file is saved.  
2. Run:  
   ```bash
   code --install-extension ./incognito-1.0.8.vsix
   ```
3. Restart VS Code and pick **Incognito** under Color Themes.

### 🔄 Updating the Theme
If a new version is released, uninstall the old one first:

```bash
code --uninstall-extension mtdickmann.incognito
```

Then reinstall the latest `.vsix` using the same method above.
